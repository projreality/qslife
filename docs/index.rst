QSLife
======

QSLife is a program for visualizing data in an HDFQS data store. In addition to simply viewing data over time, it aids the user in analyzing correlations in time by allowing the user to create multiple plots on the same time scale. Users are able to easily navigate through the data, as well as create markers to save significant points in time.
